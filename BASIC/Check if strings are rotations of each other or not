Check if strings are rotations of each other or not 
 
 
 Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
Output: 
1
Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
left-rotating s1 by 5 units.

    {
        string s1,s2;
        cin>>s1>>s2;
        string temp=s1+s1;
        if(s1.size()==s2.size())
        {
        if(temp.find(s2)!=string ::npos)
        cout<<true;
        else
        cout<<false;
        }
        else
        cout<<false;
        
        cout<<"\n";
    }
	return 0;
