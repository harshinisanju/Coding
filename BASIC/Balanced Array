Balanced Array
Given an array of even size N, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced.'
An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Sum of first 2 elements is 1 + 5  = 6, 
Sum of last 2 elements is 3 + 2  = 5,
To make the array balanced you can add 1

class Solution
{
public:
    int minValueToBalance(int a[], int n)
    {
       //code here.
       int sum=0;
       int sum1=0;
       
       for(int i=0;i<(n/2);i++)
       {
           
           sum+=a[i];
           sum1+=a[n-i-1];
           //cout<<sum<<" "<<sum1;
       }
    
       int aa=abs(sum-sum1);
       return aa;
    }
};
